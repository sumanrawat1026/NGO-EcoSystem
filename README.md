Objective
To implement an application for an NGO and connect multiple organizations through network to provide the necessary support to underprivileged children. 

Problem Overview:
The percentage of children living in low-income families (both poor and near poor) has been on the rise – increasing from 40 percent in 2006 to 45 percent in 2011. During this time period, the overall number of children of all ages increased by less than one percent while the numbers who were low-income and poor increased by 13 percent and 23 percent, respectively.
Among all children under 18 years of age, approximately 11 percent in low-income families and 10 percent in poor families are without health insurance coverage. Consistent with research suggesting older children in general are particularly at risk of being uninsured, children 12 through 17 years old in low-income and poor families are more likely to be uninsured compared to younger children in low-income and poor families.
Our goal is to build an application that provide a multi-party network through an NGO that help underprivileged and poor children get clothes, heath care and other amenities to slightly alleviate their distress. 
Application Entities:
•	NGO- Intermediary between various enterprises
  o	Admins-Handles the payroll and employees.
  o	Employees- Handles the volunteers and other enterprises
  o	Volunteers-Handles the real day- to -day of the NGO
•	Health Services-Provide free or low-cost health care to children
  o	Organizers-Organize heath drives
  o	Doctors- Provide medical support
•	Transport- Provide transport to different entities to deliver things. Schedule deliveries.
•	Garments- Provide excess and unused clothes to the children through the NGO.
These are the different organization that will be interconnected through a network and have a constant communication through work requests.
